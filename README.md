# Vehicle-Movement-Analysis-Project
Main objective of this project is to develop an Edge AI-based solution that can analyse vehicle  movement in and out of a college campus using data from cameras capturing vehicle photos and license  plates. The solution should provide insights on vehicle movement patterns, parking occupancy, and  match vehicles to an approved vehicle database.
